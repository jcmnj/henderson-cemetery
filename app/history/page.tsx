    body: "The cemetery was first known as the Denny-Henderson Cemetery, with land made available by the Denny and Henderson families for use as a public burying ground. Records suggest an approximate inception around 1800. The earliest named gravestone is Hannah Henderson (d. 1828), with earlier stones showing only initials such as J.P. (1807).",

    title: "Surveyed Family Lots and Name Change",
    body: "The Oliver Henderson family surveyed adjacent property into 54 burial lots, each with space for eight graves. As this section developed, the name shifted from Denny-Henderson Cemetery to Henderson Cemetery. A plan of lots laid out by Oliver P. Henderson was recorded in Allegheny County records on November 18, 1884 (noted in Plan Book Vol. VII, Page 114). This area is now referred to as Plan 1.",

    body: "By 1909 the grounds had become overgrown. Rev. H. J. Rose called a meeting at the cemetery on May 31, 1909 to organize care and maintenance. A charter application followed in July, and the proposed corporate name became The Harmarville Cemetery Association. Early officers and directors included Rev. Harry J. Rose, Joseph Barton, Grace B. McRoberts, William S. Carson, William Nixon, James Smeaton, and Rev. John Henderson.",

    title: "Expansion and Ongoing Stewardship",
    body: "In 1911, Anna Melzena Spring (heir to the Denny estate) donated adjoining land. One hundred additional lots were surveyed from this gift, later shown as Plan 2 on cemetery maps. Over subsequent decades, board leadership was reorganized multiple times as generations changed, including documented boards in 1952 and 1975, helping preserve the cemetery through continued local stewardship.",

            Historical records indicate that many burials were never fully
            recorded, and some gravesite details changed across documents over
            time. This archive preserves those records while ongoing review
            continues.
